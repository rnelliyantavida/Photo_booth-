            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
              Qatar – pronounced ‘kuh-TAR’–is located on the Arabian Peninsula, jutting into the Arabian Gulf. The first evidence of human settlement dates to the 6th millennium BCE. For centuries, Qatar was largely populated by Bedouin tribes and a few fishing villages, shaped by the rule of Arab tribes, Portuguese explorers, Ottoman leaders and the esteemed al-Thani family, whose leadership has significantly influenced the nation's heritage. Qatar’s destiny changed when oil was first discovered in the Dukhan Field in 1940.

            <p>
Qatar is not just about its capital city Doha, and the way it’s held on to its heritage even while moving towards the contemporary. It’s not just about modern structures and high rise buildings; it’s not just about museums and beaches; it’s not just about man made islands or purpose built hills. There’s a lot more to this small, but happening, country. With a long pristine and beautiful coastal line and plenty of sunshine all year round, Qatar is a destination where you can have it all.
